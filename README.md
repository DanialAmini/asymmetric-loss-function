asymmetric loss function for neural networks can make estimates that use over estimation

This is based on the idea presented in the paper by Elena Toth (2015) in Journal of Hydraulic Engineering titled "Asymmetric Error Functions for Reducing the Underestimation of Local Scour around Bridge Piers: Application to Neural Networks Models"
